  <p>Hi, my name is Tara Harman. I am a 3rd-year at the Mount studying Biology and Social Computing. I also work as a lab assistant and am the secretary of TriBeta, the biological honor society on campus. I am a creative writer as well and am involved in Writer's Block.
  </p>
  <p>Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my cats, Elton (pictured) and Dylan. I really enjoy travel and have a goal of visiting all 50 states someday (I am halfway there!). In my free time, I enjoy playing games, listening to music, and going out to eat/shopping!
